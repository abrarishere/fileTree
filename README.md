# File Tree Generator

## Overview
This Python script, `a.py`, generates a file tree of a specified directory and its subdirectories and files. It provides a visual representation of the directory structure using ASCII characters.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Operating system that supports Python (Windows, Linux, macOS)

## Setup
1. Download the `a.py` script.
2. Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
3. Place the `a.py` script in the directory you want to generate the file tree for.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you placed the `a.py` script.
3. Run the script by executing the following command:
   ```
   python a.py
   ```

## Examples
Suppose we have the following directory structure:

```
project/
    ├── src/
    │   ├── main.py
    │   └── utils/
    │       ├── helper.py
    │       └── constants.py
    └── README.md
```

Running the `a.py` script in the `project` directory will generate the following file tree:

```
project/
├── src/
│   ├── main.py
│   └── utils/
│       ├── helper.py
│       └── constants.py
└── README.md
```

## Limitations
- The script currently supports ASCII representation only and may not be suitable for extremely large directory structures.

## Benefits
- Provides a quick and visual way to understand the directory structure.
- Easy to use with minimal setup requirements.
- Helps in organizing and navigating through directories efficiently.
